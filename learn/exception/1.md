When writing a function that calls a method which might throw exceptions, you have two main approaches to handle those exceptions:

1. **Catch and Handle the Exception (try-catch)**
2. **Propagate the Exception (throws)**

### 1. **Catch and Handle the Exception (try-catch)**

In this approach, you use a `try-catch` block within your function to catch and handle the exception. This is useful when your function knows how to recover from the exception or when you want to log the error, clean up resources, or provide a meaningful error message to the user.

#### Example:
```java
public void myFunction() {
    try {
        riskyMethod(); // This method might throw an exception
    } catch (SpecificException e) {
        // Handle the exception, e.g., log it, clean up resources, etc.
        System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        // You can also rethrow a new exception if needed, possibly wrapping it
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to execute riskyMethod", e);
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- You can handle the exception immediately, possibly recovering or providing feedback.
- Allows for more specific handling based on the type of exception.
- Prevents the exception from propagating further up the call stack.

**Cons:**
- Handling exceptions locally can clutter the code if not done carefully.
- May lead to swallowed exceptions if not properly logged or rethrown.

### 2. **Propagate the Exception (throws)**

In this approach, you let the exception propagate up the call stack by declaring it in your method's `throws` clause. This is useful when your function cannot handle the exception or when you want the caller of your function to decide how to handle it.

#### Example:
```java
public void myFunction() throws SpecificException {
    riskyMethod(); // This method might throw an exception
}
```

Or if multiple exceptions are possible:
```java
public void myFunction() throws SpecificException, AnotherException {
    riskyMethod(); // This method might throw multiple types of exceptions
}
```

**Pros:**
- Simplifies your method by not handling exceptions directly.
- Delegates responsibility to the caller, who might be better suited to handle the exception.
- Keeps the method signature clear about the exceptions it can throw.

**Cons:**
- The caller must handle the exception, which might complicate their code.
- If not handled at any level, the exception could cause the application to crash.

### When to Use Each Approach

- **Use try-catch:**
    - When your method knows how to handle the exception (e.g., retrying an operation, providing default behavior, logging).
    - When you want to convert a checked exception to an unchecked exception (e.g., wrapping it in a `RuntimeException`).
    - When you want to prevent the exception from propagating to higher layers of the application.

- **Use throws:**
    - When your method cannot handle the exception meaningfully and wants to delegate that responsibility to the caller.
    - When you are writing a low-level method or library code where the context for handling the exception might not be known.
    - When you want to provide flexibility to the caller on how to deal with the exception.

### Combining Both Approaches

Sometimes, itâ€™s useful to combine both approaches. You might catch an exception to log or clean up resources and then rethrow it:

```java
public void myFunction() throws SpecificException {
    try {
        riskyMethod(); // This method might throw an exception
    } catch (SpecificException e) {
        // Log the error or clean up
        System.out.println("Error in riskyMethod: " + e.getMessage());
        // Rethrow the exception to let the caller handle it
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This way, you ensure that necessary actions (like logging) are performed while still allowing the caller to handle the exception.
